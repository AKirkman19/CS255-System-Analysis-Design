The client was the owner of DriverPass and they wanted us to work to design an online system that allowed users to manage their information, schedule trainings, select packages, and improve the training for drivers. I think through out the course of this project I improved a lot interms of understanding the UML diagrams and it aided in being able to read and create them for future assignments. I think in terms of revisals or improvements I think I would always look at the functional and non-functional requirements and the possible maintenance additions. In the future if the users submit concerns or technical issues then the team would revisit and see what needs to change to solve the issues. I interpreted and implemented the users' needs into the system design by following all of the comapnies requirements and taking it a step further to come up with alternatives. It is important to always consider the users' needs when designing because that w=is what the company bases their success on. When designing software I take a look at the functional and non-functional requirements once again. I like to make sure I organize my code aligned with the project requirements so I dont miss anything. In the future I hope to be working on a team as opposed to individually because I can get more feedback on my program.
